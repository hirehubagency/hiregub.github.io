            <p>Vision summary</p>
		<p>This beautiful country is like a fearsome machine. A harmony of industries that makes this economy the global powerhouse that it is. But, as any great machine man has built, in order for overall efficiency to be at peak, attention has to be paid to the pieces that make other pieces work, the small gears that connect and support the other aspects of the apparatus; in short, the country’s workforce.</p>
            <p>Recruitment by community benchmark</p>
            <p>Our approach of sourcing workers from digital communities on social platforms has an abundance of direct advantages from vetting people by their behavior among their peers to connecting with people in a distressing situation i.e. unemployed, without housing thus giving way for a longer partnership. Workers whom reach out to us have the opportunity to go through our “Community benchmark questionnaires” establishing not just their value as an employee, but as a citizen. </p>
		<p>One size does not fit all </p>
		<p>By observing different contexts of workplace synergy we have come to the realization that worker satisfaction is a deciding factor in a company’s production output. Our approach of career optimization takes into account different aspects like skill, social and psychological proficiency when assigning roles as studies show people have an higher work output when performing tasks they find suitable. By differentiating between i.e. people who like to perform repetitive tasks or do physical work or people who like being part of a team and people who prefer to go at it alone, we can achieve a boost to up to 35% productivity increase. </p>
		<p>The perfect worker, The perfect business </p>
		<p>Knowing our employees is just part of the business, the other part and just as exciting, if not a bit more, is knowing our client. After profiling our stuff and looking at the industries we can help, our sourcing process starts in which our sales department carefully analyses different aspects of the business, such as production output, growth opportunities, high traffic hours, high traffic areas, extra work necessities and optimization opportunities.</p>
		<p>Adapt and overcome </p>
		<p>With the assessment on both sides complete we are ready to fulfill the needs of the customer. Whatever the customer needs, we have it at the ready: workers grouped on preferences such as consistency and planning will be available for full time divided in certain age groups for morning, day, evening and night shift; others who prefer improvisation and a dynamic workflow will be available for our Flex Program, filling in real time and on demand to compensate and efficiently mediate high production fluxes that span a few hours or weekend days. </p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>A team within a team</p>
            <p>For our Flex working, teams will be in place with coordinators at their head who will act as a relay for feedback from the client’s team leaders. They will be trained in the activities of the client as to accommodate our employees without disturbing the workflow. Ready to gather a force form an always available roster with various skills and orientations, they can be on site in under an hour. </p>
	    <p>For the people </p>
            <p>A deciding factor in low professional development is the individual’s dissatisfaction with personal life. For some reason people can’t separate personal life and work. Although, after examining the problem closer, that reason seems to be that most of the temporary and immigrant workers don’t actually know what their financial goal is or their goal is financial stability and they don’t know that.</p>
  	    <p>By the people</p>
	    <p>To tackle this issue we have developed a financial fulfillment department aimed at helping our employees discover their goals and pave ways to obtaining them. Studies show that most people working through recruitment agencies are uneducated in personal finances and how that interconnects in local economy, creating great dissatisfaction which seeps into their professional lives. Our aim is to fill this gap by offer consultancy for our employees short and long term savings, investing and at a point in our projected growth, offer personal loans. </p>
            <p>To sum up </p>
            <p>Some people say production mean three things: The worker, The business and Their relation. If that is the case then we have successfully increased the worker by giving meaning to their work, the business by precisely molding our services to their needs and reinvigorated the relationship between employee and business by helping the worker set and then achieve financial their financial goals. “Our homes are a reflection of ourselves” means among other things that everybody should have one, so after the community benchmark questionnaire we help our sanitation oriented, respectful workers find suitable housing.  But, as we originally stated as one of our company’s goals, we aim to help people reach their value as their citizen and with that in mind, at the start of our collaboration we offer free Dutch courses.  Though it is understandable that everyone should be given the opportunity to be part of our social development initiative and our potential sustainable number of investor shareholders is limited we are very excited to reach out to potential mentors and investors and find the most suitable match! </p>
